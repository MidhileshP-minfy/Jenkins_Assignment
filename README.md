### Outcome of this Assignment:
I learned how to work through Jenkins dashboard and understand how to build a project. I also learned that building a project is really straight forward and we can create a pipeline easily by using the script. The console output helped me to understand what is going on in the script I gave line by line. Stage view provides a good visual representation of the stages we created in pipeline execution. We can also make changes and create a new build.
